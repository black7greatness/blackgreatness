                <h3>The young people in Africa</h3>
                <p>The young people in Africa are confronted with multiple
                    challenges ranging from economies that grew but could
                    not create sufficient jobs prior to the global financial
                    and economic crisis to sluggish growth post the crisis in
                    part arising from adverse weather conditions and poor
                    commodity prices. Africa is the only region where the
                    youth bulge will continue to grow in the foreseeable
                    future, presenting both an opportunity to reap the
                    demographic dividend and an imminent time bomb and
                    threat to social cohesion as well as massive migration in
                    search of opportunities if appropriate policies are not
                    implemented to harness the dividend.
                    Just over one in five youth were not in employment,
                    education or training (NEET) in 2019; this state of
                    joblessness has been steadily growing since 2012
                    mirroring the trends in the global rate (Table 1). The NEET
                    rate is projected to increase slightly by 0.3 percentage
                    points to 20.8 in 2021. Young women are particularly
                    more affected by the NEET status with a gender gap of
                    around 10 percentage points since 2018. However, Africa’s
                    gender gap compares favourably globally and particularly
                    compared to Asia Pacific and Arab States regions where
                    it is in the region of over 20 and 30 percentage points
                    respectively. One interesting feature is that while the
                    NEET rate for young men has been increasing since 2012,
                    that of young women declined between 2012 and 2018.
                    The NEET rate in Africa is mainly driven by high rates
                    in Northern Africa where rates of above 26 percent are
                    observed compared to below 20 percent in Sub-Saharan
                    Africa. Cultural norms and barriers as well as differences
                    in economic coping mechanisms in the two sub-regions
                    partly explain the disparities.

                <h4>Youth extreme working poverty</h4> 
                <p>Africa’s trajectory of youth extreme working poverty has
                    been on the decline and although still above the global
                    average, it is declining at a higher pace than the global
                    trend from 42.1 per cent in 2012 to 38.4 in 2019 and is
                    projected to decline further to 37.6 and 36.9 percent in
                    2020 and 2021. The decline in extreme poverty could
                    reflect the general increase in Africa’s middle class with
                    many households graduating to moderate poverty or
                    leaving poverty altogether. The gender gap has remained
                    small and is on the decline. However it is projected to
                    increase slightly in 2020 and 2021.
                     The high poverty rates in Africa reflect the largely poor
                    quality of work young people and their families engage in
                    mostly in the informal economy. A recent study1 by the ILO
                    (2018) show that an overwhelming majority of the youth
                    aged 15-24 (94.9 per cent) are informally employed, with
                    no or little education, are rural based and mainly engaged
                    in subsistence agriculture. Nonetheless educated youth
                    also find refuge in the informal economy – two thirds
                    with secondary education and close to one-third with
                    tertiary education were in the informal sector. More
                    young people are engaged in the informal economy in
                    Sub-Saharan Africa (95.8 percent) compared to Northern
                    Africa (87.5 percent).
                    Young adults (aged 25-29) are less likely to be in the
                    informal economy than their younger counterparts.
                    While more young women are in the informal economy
                    than their male counterparts, the gender gap is small but
                    increases with age.
                    To sustainably address the employment challenges
                    Africa is facing, particularly for the youth and to reap the
                    demographic dividend, concerted efforts are needed to
                    implement an appropriate and customised mix of proemployment policies and programmes at macro, sectoral
                    and labour market levels with a strong emphasis on the
                    demand side support for structural transformation while
                    paying attention to disadvantaged groups in the labour
                    market.
